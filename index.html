	<p>ABC ME's Education block broadcasts weekdays from 10.00am â€“ 12.00pm during the school term.
We also have an Education collection permanently available on ABC iView.<br>

ABC TV has been broadcasting to schools for over forty years. Originally a direct broadcast of lessons by teachers, it is now quality television across a breadth of subject areas driving lesson plans. We aim to provide dynamic, award-winning content that is visually engaging, encourages curiosity, and brings learning into their lives rather than just at school.<br>

Catering to both primary and secondary students, we cover all key learning areas such as Maths, Science, English, History and non-core curricular subjects such as, Geography, Arts, Technologies and Indigenous Studies.<br>

We aim to acquire programs that have extended materials ready-made; study guides interpreting curriculum or the ability to catch-up with the program on iview.<br>

Our TV Education block is inspiring, responding to a broad and diverse curriculum and showcasing the best learning content in the world.<br>

ABC ME can be found on channel 23 on Freeview and on channel 723 on Foxtel.
